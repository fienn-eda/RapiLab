# Special skill mechanics (easy to misencode)

A living catalog of NIKKE mechanics that are **easy to misread** — things that
look defensive or irrelevant but are actually DPS, cross-unit synergies, or
otherwise need care. Both the main agent (encoding) and the subagents
(data-collector when dumping skills, docs-keeper when recording) should consult
this and **append a new entry whenever a special mechanic comes up** (Fienn's
standing request). Keep entries short: what it is, why it's easy to get wrong,
how to encode it, and current engine status.

## Distributed Damage (분산 대미지)
- **What:** `distributed_damage_up` ("Distributed Damage ▲ X%") is a **DPS
  buff** that raises the damage of Nikkes whose kit deals *Distributed Damage*
  (e.g. Scarlet: Black Shadow — https://nikke.gg/characters/scarlet-black-shadow/).
- **Easy mistake:** reading it as a defensive / off-DPS stat and skipping it. It
  is not defensive.
- **Encode:** emit it as a `squad` effect (the buffer buffs the whole squad's
  distributed damage; only distributed-damage units actually have any to boost).
- **Engine status:** `distributed_damage_up` exists in `damage_formula.py` but
  `raid_simulator.py` does not consume it yet, and proper support needs per-unit
  gating so only distributed-damage units benefit. So it is currently **inert** —
  encode it faithfully (so it starts counting once wired) but know it moves no
  damage until (a) the stat is wired and (b) a distributed-damage dealer is
  encoded with a "has distributed damage" flag. Seen on: Anchor: Innocent Maid
  (Starfish Omurice, Twice tier).

## Debuff-stack reduction enabling stack retention
- **What:** some supporters reduce an ally-side debuff stack count ("Stack count
  of debuffs ▼ N"), e.g. Anchor: Innocent Maid's Starfish Omurice (Three-times
  tier).
- **Why it matters:** it can keep a self-stacking ally *below* a self-stun /
  self-reset threshold, changing that ally's average buff output. Concretely it
  lets **Mast: Romantic Maid** hold Drunken at 3 stacks instead of hitting the
  max-stack Hangover stun that resets her.
- **Encode:** model as a **deck-composition dependency** on the *consuming* unit,
  not as an emitted effect. Mast checks `deck_contains("anchor-innocent-maid")`
  and picks its Drunken stack schedule accordingly (`min(cycle,3)` with Anchor
  vs `((cycle-1)%3)+1` solo). See `mast_romantic_maid.py`.

## Escalating "Once / Twice / Three times" buffs
- **What:** "Effect changes according to the number of activation times.
  Previous effects trigger repeatedly. Once: … Twice: … Three times: …". Each
  tier unlocks on its activation and all unlocked tiers keep applying.
- **Encode:** use `_helpers.escalating_buff_rule(trigger, tiers)` — it reads
  `SquadContext.activation_count` and applies tiers 1..N on the Nth firing
  (per burst cycle). Put an empty list for a tier whose effect isn't DPS or
  isn't modeled (e.g. a Hit Rate step). **Do not flatten these to a steady-state
  max** — Fienn wants the per-cycle ramp (and it composes with deck-dependent
  behaviour like Mast's). Seen on: Anchor (both passives).
